# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing PDF processing system to be more robust, cross-platform compatible, and efficient. The current system has dependency issues with native packages like `canvas` on Windows and needs better error handling, performance optimization, and alternative processing methods for different types of PDF content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a PDF processing system that works reliably across different operating systems without requiring complex native dependencies, so that the application can be deployed and developed on any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes PDFs THEN it SHALL work on Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring Visual Studio build tools or similar native compilation dependencies
2. WHEN native dependencies fail to install THEN the system SHALL provide fallback processing methods that maintain core functionality
3. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL detect the availability of optional dependencies and gracefully degrade functionality if they are not available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to efficiently process different types of PDF content including text-based, scanned, and mixed documents, so that I can extract meaningful information from any PDF format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing text-based PDFs THEN the system SHALL extract text content with high accuracy and preserve formatting context
2. WHEN processing scanned PDFs THEN the system SHALL use OCR with fallback options if primary OCR service is unavailable
3. WHEN processing mixed content PDFs THEN the system SHALL identify and handle both text and image content appropriately
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other pages and provide partial results rather than failing completely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large PDF files and multiple documents efficiently without consuming excessive memory or processing time, so that I can work with substantial document collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large PDF files THEN the system SHALL use streaming or chunked processing to manage memory usage
2. WHEN processing multiple PDFs THEN the system SHALL process them in batches to prevent memory overflow
3. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and allow for graceful cancellation
4. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL skip redundant processing to improve efficiency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can understand what went wrong when PDF processing fails and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including file path, page number, and error type
2. WHEN individual pages fail to process THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining pages and report partial success
3. WHEN critical dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of successful and failed operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular PDF processing architecture that allows for easy testing, maintenance, and extension with new processing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing PDF processors THEN each processing method SHALL be implemented as a separate, testable module
2. WHEN adding new processing capabilities THEN the system SHALL support plugin-style architecture for easy extension
3. WHEN testing the system THEN each processing component SHALL have comprehensive unit tests with mock data
4. WHEN processing methods fail THEN the system SHALL automatically try alternative processing methods in a defined fallback chain
